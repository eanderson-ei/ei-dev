# Step 1: Start at the End

Describe the world as it would be if the problem were solved. Be agnostic about the solution, just describe your vision for world. A **vision statement** is a good place to start. A vision statement should meet the following criteria:

* Idealistic
* About the future
* Observable
* Not about the intervention

Don’t wordsmith the vision statement quite yet. It’s just intended to provide a guiding light or goal post throughout this process. You may choose to re-write it later once you better understand the problem.

If using the Open Standards, include in your vision the **conservation targets**. Don’t worry about defining measurable goals yet, unless they are already defined.

If desired, write down **design principles** to guide you through this process. These principles should reflect your values and any **constraints** on the solution; they will guide decision making throughout the process. See examples [here](https://principles.design/).

#### Other Techniques

- Ask a question: If you’re not quite sure how you think the world could be improved, but sense that there is room for improvement, just ask yourself the question: how might this be better? Could we do this in a different (e.g., more efficient/equitable) way? Keep asking yourself questions until you have a good sense of what can be changed. Asking the right design question is essential to solving the right problem.
- Bug list: another approach to visualizing a better world is writing down all of the things that bug you about the current situation. Is one of those ‘bugs’ sufficiently problematic that it’s worth investing time and resources in addressing?
