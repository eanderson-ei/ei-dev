Welcome to Environmental Incentives' Metrics Service Line Wiki! 

This wiki is intended for [all EI staff](#all-ei-staff) to better understand the services of the Metrics service line and for [Metrics service line experts](#metrics-service-line-experts) as an important standard reference. Don't build a giant house of cards! We can help you develop solutions that last.

### All EI Staff

If you're here to better understand how the Metrics service line can support your project or internal initiative, you might want to check out our [portfolio of projects](portfolio/project-portfolio.md), better understand [how we can work with you](metrics-services/how-we-work.md), or review one of these helpful introductions to technologies and services available to you:

* Data Analysis
* [Tool Development](deployment/deployment-overview.md)
* [Databases](data-management/database-overview.md)
* [Visualization](data-visualization/data-visualization.md)
* Mapping and Spatial Analysis

### Metrics Service Line Experts

Metrics service line experts will want to familiarize themselves with all of the content here. This site provides helpful training resources, captures best practices for developing metrics products, and describes our standard consulting process for internal and external clients.
