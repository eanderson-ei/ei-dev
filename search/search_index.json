Are you scrambling to pull together information when requested, constantly months behind in reporting, or finding yourself dumping data from multiple sources into a single spreadsheet for analysis? If so, it might be time for a database. However, there are complexities to consider when setting up and managing a database. This tutorial will introduce you to databases , describe available database solutions , and help you select the right database for your needs . Introduction to Databases \u00b6 A database is simply an organized store for information. Data are stored as rows and columns in tables; relationships are defined between tables (hence the name, \"relational database\"). You might have tables for customers, products, and orders. Customers place orders which include products. The database helps you get the right products to the right customers. How the data are stored is often less important than how the data are accessed. The primary reason you're developing a database is probably to make data easier to access, analyze and report. When choosing and designing a database, you'll need to pay as much attention to how the user will interface with the database as the database solution itself. If you're simply looking for data analysis and visualization (think: Tableau), check out our Introduction to Data Visualization . Interacting with a database \u00b6 Most users will interact with a database through a navigation form. The navigation form surfaces the important functionality of the database, including entering data, querying data, and generating reports. Here's an example navigation form for a bakery's order database created in Microsoft Access. The navigation form is set up after the database is configured by the database administrator (DBA; this may be you, someone on the Metrics Service Line, or an outside contractor). The navigation form--as well as other forms, queries, and reports that are made available to the user by the DBA--make data accessible to users while protecting the integrity of the database Forms \u00b6 Data is entered into the database primarily through forms (it can be imported as well). Forms can be made available through the Navigation Form or through individual forms designed and made available by the DBA. Queries \u00b6 Queries allow you to search for and update records in the database. Want to know how many orders were placed yesterday? How many blueberry muffins you've sold this year? You'll need a query for that. Reports \u00b6 Reports are queries or collections of queries that can be batched together and run periodically. You might have a standard report that is produced each quarter or a ready-made report to provide real time information to your boss when requested. Reports must also be set up and made available by the DBA. A database solution involves multiple components \u00b6 A database solution (aka database management system; DBMS) will include these key components Database Engine and Hosting Platform : The database engine is the software that runs the database. The database and the database engine will be hosted either on a local server or on the cloud. Database Management Client : The database management client is the interface that the DBA will use to configure the database and manage access for users. The database client helps reduce, but doesn't necessarily eliminate, the need to use SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the database. User Interface and Analysis Platform : The user interface allows users to access the data while the analysis platform allows the user to gain insights from the data. Often, these are combined. To illustrate, below are three options for a database solution that you might consider. Example 1: Microsoft Access \u00b6 Microsoft Access is an all-in-one database solution from the '90s. It lacks many features that some would deem critical, but for lightweight and desktop-based database solutions, it's hard to beat the out-of-the-box functionality for low-tech users. More modern options are available as cloud-based, subscription services. Example 2: Microsoft Azure SQL Database + SQL Server Management Studio + Microsoft PowerApps \u00b6 A cloud-based solution that offers great customization, if you're tech-savvy enough to configure and maintain it. You don't have to be a software engineer, but don't expect it to be easy. Amazon and Oracle offer similar solutions. Example 3: MySQL + MySQL Workbench + Custom Web Application \u00b6 This open source solution may be your go-to if you're building a website and working with a web developer. Many open source solutions are available. Project Spotlight: The Registry for the Monarch Butterfly Habitat Exchange was built on this stack. Database Options \u00b6 There are many choices when it comes to databases, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. All-in-one, low tech solutions \u00b6 These are your options if you don't have a tech guru on the team and don't have enough budget to hire one. Free(ish) and Mostly Desktop-Based \u00b6 Microsoft Access and OpenOffice Base are good entry-level options. OpenOffice Base is free but has fewer features and less support than Microsoft Access. Microsoft Excel , especially if paired with custom VBA Forms and Modules, can even serve as a database but has limitations (it pains me to even suggest this). If you'd prefer a cloud-based solution, Google Sheets paired with Google Forms might even work. Cheap(ish) Cloud-based Subscription Services \u00b6 The need for data storage and analytics solutions to serve low-tech users has led to a boom in cloud-based solutions like AirTable , QuickBase , TeamDesk , Knack , and Sonadier . The price scales with increasing storage capacity and number of users, from cheap ($5/month) to not-so-cheap ($500/month or more). The data visualization powerhouse Tableau offers a data management add-on for $5/mo that might meet your needs if you're mostly focused on visualization and are already a Tableau subscriber. Salesforce and other CRMs (Customer Relationship Management software) also combine data management and analytics in a way that could serve as a solution for your needs. Finally, one notable desktop application is Notion , which is a do-everything app with a cult following that provides some database-like functionality. Solutions for the more technical crowd \u00b6 Venture into this territory and you'll want to make sure you have the technical chops on board to configure and maintain these options. Open Source Database Software \u00b6 PostgreSQL , MySQL , and MariaDB are examples of open source (free) database solutions. While these are robust, scalable database solutions used by many large corporations, they are not designed for your everyday desk jockey. These open source solutions are often paired with a web-based interface. If you are working with a web developer and have the budget for them to design the forms, queries and reports you need you'll likely choose one of these open source options. Don't forget you'll probably need to hire them again when your version of the software is no longer supported by its open source community. Cloud-based Scalable Services \u00b6 Cloud-based options are offered by Amazon RCD , Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Services . Your data now lives on the cloud. Price scales with use, and entry-level tiers can be very cheap, but you will have to provide a credit card and make sure the charges don't get out of hand. To get to your data, you'll need an application--either a custom web app or a desktop app you build using a service like Microsoft PowerApps , FileMaker , Oracle Forms , or Appian . These \"low code\" application platforms allow you to develop custom solutions without a team of software engineers, but do require some serious training. Enterprise Database Solutions \u00b6 Microsoft, IBM, and Oracle all sell enterprise database solutions. Expect to pay over $1,000 per month. You can get Microsoft SQL Server Express for free but make sure its limited set of features will work for you. Database Clients \u00b6 For these more technical solutions, you'll need a database management client. Some database solutions come with a preferred client, such as Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio and Azure Data Studio , Oracle's SQL Developer , PostreSQL's pgAdmin , and MySQL's MySQL Workbench . However, you're not stuck with these options, some of these can be used for other databases, while a number of popular free alternative options exist including SQuirrel SLQ , DataGrip , or even VSCode with mssql extension (for MySQL databases; however see Azure Data Studio as a better solution built from the VSCode platform). How to Choose? \u00b6 With so many options, how do you choose? This section will help you pick the right one. Budget \u00b6 Consider both the cost of the software itself and the cost of configuring and maintaining the database. Scalability \u00b6 Unless you're dealing with *Big Data*, you won't need to worry about the database growing too large to fit on a single server. The only likely exception would be if attempting to store geospatial data within a relational database outside of ArcGIS. If you go with a cloud-based solution you can scale as much as you want, provided you can pay for it. Hosting & Integration \u00b6 If the database will be hosted and managed by the client or their website manager, your options will likely be limited to those that integrate with their existing systems. Work with them when selecting a database and during database design. In most other cases, the database will live on the client's local server (unless you picked a cloud-based alternative). Maintenance & Support \u00b6 Who will maintain the database over time? If it's the client, make sure they are comfortable with the solution. Who will provide support if something crashes or the client needs a new type of report developed? If it's you, make sure you are comfortable with the solution. Keep in mind that paying a contractor to set up a cool web-based database will likely require paying a contractor to maintain that database periodically over time. Final Thoughts \u00b6 Setting up a database is a big step in the maturation of any data-driven program. The right database solution will keep your data safe and secure while also providing access to the data for analysis and reporting. When choosing a database, the best strategy is to keep it as simple as possible. Important! If you've decided that you're not the right person to decide which database to use, that's ok. While someone with more technical experience will be better able to select the right database solution, they may not know enough about your program to design the database and the forms, queries and reports you need. You're the expert on your program, stay involved in the process to make sure the final solution meets your needs!","title":"Database Overview"},{"location":"data-management/database-overview/#introduction-to-databases","text":"A database is simply an organized store for information.

We have two options: Create the project locally and push it up to Github* Create the project on Github first and clone it down to your computer *If you already have a project started, you've already started locally. Starting Locally \u00b6 If you have already started a project or prefer to work from your local machine first, follow these steps: 1. Create the project directory \u00b6 In Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder in which you will create your project directory (or the root of an existing project directory). Right-click and select 'GitBash Here' to open an instance of Bash. Skip the following paragraph if you already have a project started . Use the command mkdir <project-name> (replace <project-name> with the name of the directory for the project) to create a folder. Next, use the command cd <project-name> to move into that folder. 2. Initialize git \u00b6 Use the command git init to initialize git. A new repository named .git will be created within the directory which stores all of the git version control. You don't need to have GitBash open during your editing sessions, this folder will take care of all of your version control. If for some reason you want to stop tracking with git and lose all of your previous versions, just delete this folder. 3. Create a .gitignore and README.md file \u00b6 Use the command touch .gitignore to create a new file named .gitignore. This file will be used by git to ignore files in the project that should not be tracked. Use the command code .gitignore to open VSCode to edit the file (or however you would open and edit files). Using one line per folder or file, list all folders or files to be ignored. Wildcards (i.e., globbing patterns) are honored. Each project will be different but consider including *.pyc , venv , idea . See this GitHub help page for more on .gitignore files and this repo for suggested files to ignore. Use the command touch README.md to create a README file. This file will automatically be displayed on the repository page on Github. Using the Markdown language, populate this README file with important info as necessary. 4. Commit your initial file(s) \u00b6 First, we'll need to add all files to be tracked by git. Use the command: 1 git add -A Next we'll use a commit to get the first batch of files/folders into our git repository. Use the following command: 1 git commit -m \"Initial Commit\" You will learn more about commits and other features of git in the Using Git section. 5. Create a Github repository \u00b6 Navigate to your Github.com page and login. Click the green Create New Repository button. Name it with the same name you used in step 1 for the project directory. Provide a description. The repository will be public. DO NOT create a README or .gitignore file. After you click 'Ok', Github will provide instructions for importing your project files into the repository. Use HTTP or SSH if you have it set up. Copy the url provided to your clipboard. You'll use two commands in GitBash to accomplish this: 1 2 git remote add origin <url> git push -u origin master --tags The first line establishes a remote connection to the repository. Replace the url with the url provided by github to your project repository. Note that you can change the name 'origin' to anything you'd like, but origin is used by convention. You will be prompted to sign into your Github account. The second line 'pushes' your files/folders up to Github. The -u flag tells Github to track these files/folders along with master, while the --tags flag will move any messages from previous commits. If this fails, it may be because you already have a remote established named 'origin'. Try git remove rm origin to remove any existing connections, or change the name origin to something unique. To confirm your remote connection was established, use the command git remote -v . 6. Create your project structure and begin coding! \u00b6 At this point, you may wish to switch into your IDE and open the project folder to build your project architecture and begin coding. Follow the workflow described in the Using Git section as you work. Starting Remote \u00b6 In this option, we'll start by creating a repository on Github and then clone that down to our computer. You can copy files/folders into this newly created repository if you'd like. 1. Create a Gihub repository \u00b6 Navigate to your Github.com page and login. Click the green Create New Repository button. Provide a description. The repository will be public. Create a README and .gitignore file. Optionally add a license. 2. Clone the remote repository \u00b6 Within the project repository on Github, click the 'Clone or Download' button. Use HTTP or SSH if you have it set up. Copy the url provided to your clipboard. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder in which you will create your project directory. Right-click and select 'GitBash Here' to open an instance of Bash. Clone the repository into this folder with the command: 1 git clone <url> where you replace <url> with the copied url (use Shift+Insert to paste into Bash). You may provide a name for the project following the url if you'd like the folder on your local drive to have a different name than the repository on Github. Run ls to confirm that the repository was created. Type the command cd <repository-name> to move into the repository folder (replace <repository name> with the correct name). If you need to copy files/folders into the repository, use the command cp -R <~/path/> . . Replace <~/path/> with the correct path of the source folder/file. The -R flag signifies recursive and copies everything from within the folders as well. The . simply means the current directory, so your copying everything from the path provided to the current directory. 3. Populate the .gitignore file \u00b6 The .gitignore file will be used by git to ignore files in the project that should not be tracked. Use the command code .gitignore to open VSCode to edit the file (or however you would open and edit files). Using one line per folder or file, list all folders or files to be ignored.

Open Standards/Systems Thinking are focused on identifying the right place to intervene - but are, in my opinion, lacking in specifics as to how to design and implement a successful solution. Bringing the concepts within these processes together creates a more wholistic, and hopefully impactful, approach to conservation. So how is it unique? \u00b6 There's a few key characteristics of this philosophy that make it unique. People-first : This philosophy is unapologetically people-centric. We seek to change people's behavior to achieve our conservation targets. We do that by solving people's problems or creating new opportunities for people. If changing human behavior isn't at the core of your problem or central to the success of your strategy, this isn't the right process for you. Evidence-based : Prepare to test every assumption! We seek evidence from the very beginning of the process - we do not wait until we've implemented the program to start testing our assumptions. Importantly, we do not even entertain solutions until we have strong evidence that the problem exists and that solving it will help achieve our conservation target. And we never commit to our solution unless we see results in the real world. Inverted : If you're used to spending years developing the perfect program, creating a monitoring plan, and then seeing what happens, this might be disorienting. Instead, you will build the minimum solution required to begin testing assumptions. This might actually look a lot different than the full solution you're trying to build, that's ok. You'll greatly reduce the chances of wasting your time - or even making the problem worse - if you fail fast and fail small , as some like to say. Once you've found success, iterate and scale up. The Process \u00b6 We've codified our philosophy into a seven step process. Each step is described in more detail on the pages linked through here. Also, note that there are templates, additional guidance, and other resources available in Additional Resources , many of which are referenced within these linked pages.

A Situation Model , Systems Map , or Journey Map are all great tools. The Situation Model focuses on relationships between human causes (drivers) of threats to your vision (conservation targets); whereas the Systems Map describes feedback loops between relevant elements of the system. Journey Maps capture the chain of behaviors required to solve a problem or do a job. If you can, start by defining the scope of the system that you will be exploring, such as geographic boundaries or levels (e.g., federal vs. state gov\u2019t). This will help focus your search to just that area of the problem space in which you have a manageable interest . Alternatively, use a framing question to focus your interrogation of the system. Developing these maps typically requires formative research and immersion in the problem space. Start by listing the factors (i.e., threats, drivers and enabling conditions ) that you know and building out the map using a breadth-first search of the problem space. Add to the map anything that seems relevant, but don\u2019t spend too much time understanding how. Group items using affinity mapping until the relationships become clear. Next, focus on what appear to be the most important elements with an in-depth search.

The first step is to identify stakeholders\u2014all of the people that can affect or will be affected by the change you want to see. Then, you will seek to develop empathy for key stakeholders and their needs/problems. This will provide insight into a solution that is more likely to be adopted, supported, persist, and create real change. Create a stakeholder list . Search or ask around to build out your list. Consider government agencies, NGOs, academia, individual businesses, industry groups, segments of the population, etc. Group stakeholders to create a manageable list if possible, but try not to obscure the efforts of individual organizations. For example, if Molson-Coors is very active in your area of interest, keep them separate. If your more worried about the impact of beverage companies in general, group them together. As your building your list, capture a sentence or two about why they are relevant so you don\u2019t forget. You can categorize stakeholders based on how directly you can influence them.

Do you still? It will do no good to solve the wrong problem; it might actually do more harm! There are many examples of well-meaning groups attempting to solve a problem with their \u2018cure-all\u2019 and seen it fall flat--or worse, exacerbate existing problems. To a hammer, the whole world's a nail \u00b6 Many of the frameworks that inspired this approach suggest defining your group's mission at the outset. We prefer to be fully agnostic as to the solution until the problem is clearly defined and evidence supports your understanding. We recognize that your group has unique strengths and experience with some solutions more than others. If the problem doesn't call for your solution, that's fine, you can go solve a different one. The temptation is simply too great to frame the problem in terms of your solution if you come with preconceptions as to what your strategy will be. So how do we define a problem and develop our solution? Let\u2019s go back to our map. If you\u2019ve developed a systems map, look for leverage points . If you\u2019ve developed a situation model, identify key intervention points --which factor will you focus on? If you haven\u2019t already, map other stakeholders\u2019 interventions onto your map. Are there factors that aren\u2019t receiving enough attention? Where could other interventions be leveraged? Don\u2019t worry about the how (i.e., your strategy) yet. Once you\u2019ve identified the factor you\u2019d like to address, review your stakeholder list. Which of your boundary partners are relevant to this factor? Refer back to their personas and describe the problem scenarios that they face relevant to your understanding of the situation scope. These can be either problems or simply jobs to be done: Farmers aren\u2019t sure where to find information on conservation programs. Agency staff need to develop restoration project specifications but aren\u2019t experts in restoration. CSR managers need to meet biodiversity targets but don\u2019t have time to develop habitat projects. You get the picture. Depending on how broad your scope, this task may seem nebulous. Here are a few options to help clarify: For each persona, draft an outcome challenge --the ideal behavior you want each persona to adopt in a world in which your vision is achieved. You can break this down into progress markers by defining what you would expect to see, like to see, and love to see from each persona. Create a journey map . A journey map illustrates the steps the persona takes to complete a relevant task or solve a relevant problem. For example, if you envision restaurants sustainably sourcing ingredients, map out a typical process for creating procurement policies. Where do they begin? Who else is involved? Within the journey map, highlight pain points --areas where the process is difficult. Those pain points may just turn into the problems you choose to tackle. A behavior chain is similar to a journey map, and outlines the unique, self-contained behaviors necessary to complete a more complex behavior. To identify problems that are actually solvable, consider organizing them as parent, anchor and child scenarios. The parent problem is too big; the child scenario to small. The anchor problem , just right. For each anchor problem, consider alternatives --what is the persona doing now instead of what you want them to do; what other options currently exist that they\u2019re not using? Understanding the alternatives is necessary to understand the baseline and to specify conditions of satisfaction --in other words, how you\u2019ll know your solution is sufficiently better than the alternatives that the user will consider it. Craft problem hypotheses for the problems you most want to address or think are most important. These testable propositions will be evaluated through persona interviews or focus groups (you may want to combine this step with the persona interviews in step 3). Before moving on to the next step, where you will identify potential strategies, it is critical that you have a clear understanding of the problem space and have evidence supporting your hypotheses. By now you should have talked to experts and interviewed at least 5 relevant people. For more substantial endeavors, shoot for 30 people. There is no guarantee that this process will deliver a solution that will help you reach your vision for the world, but the chances of having an impact in a system you don\u2019t understand with people you can\u2019t relate to are slim. Research all at once? \u00b6 To maximize the efficiency of your research process, and avoid having to interview people twice, you may want to hold off on interviews until you've developed both persona hypotheses and problem hypotheses.

There are many examples of well-meaning groups attempting to solve a problem with their \u2018cure-all\u2019 and seen it fall flat--or worse, exacerbate existing problems.","title":"Step 4: Define the Problem"},{"location":"metrics-design/step4-define-the-problem/#to-a-hammer-the-whole-worlds-a-nail","text":"Many of the frameworks that inspired this approach suggest defining your group's mission at the outset. We prefer to be fully agnostic as to the solution until the problem is clearly defined and evidence supports your understanding. We recognize that your group has unique strengths and experience with some solutions more than others. If the problem doesn't call for your solution, that's fine, you can go solve a different one. The temptation is simply too great to frame the problem in terms of your solution if you come with preconceptions as to what your strategy will be. So how do we define a problem and develop our solution? Let\u2019s go back to our map. If you\u2019ve developed a systems map, look for leverage points . If you\u2019ve developed a situation model, identify key intervention points --which factor will you focus on? If you haven\u2019t already, map other stakeholders\u2019 interventions onto your map. Are there factors that aren\u2019t receiving enough attention? Where could other interventions be leveraged? Don\u2019t worry about the how (i.e., your strategy) yet. Once you\u2019ve identified the factor you\u2019d like to address, review your stakeholder list. Which of your boundary partners are relevant to this factor? Refer back to their personas and describe the problem scenarios that they face relevant to your understanding of the situation scope. These can be either problems or simply jobs to be done: Farmers aren\u2019t sure where to find information on conservation programs. Agency staff need to develop restoration project specifications but aren\u2019t experts in restoration. CSR managers need to meet biodiversity targets but don\u2019t have time to develop habitat projects. You get the picture. Depending on how broad your scope, this task may seem nebulous. Here are a few options to help clarify: For each persona, draft an outcome challenge --the ideal behavior you want each persona to adopt in a world in which your vision is achieved. You can break this down into progress markers by defining what you would expect to see, like to see, and love to see from each persona. Create a journey map . A journey map illustrates the steps the persona takes to complete a relevant task or solve a relevant problem. For example, if you envision restaurants sustainably sourcing ingredients, map out a typical process for creating procurement policies. Where do they begin? Who else is involved? Within the journey map, highlight pain points --areas where the process is difficult. Those pain points may just turn into the problems you choose to tackle. A behavior chain is similar to a journey map, and outlines the unique, self-contained behaviors necessary to complete a more complex behavior. To identify problems that are actually solvable, consider organizing them as parent, anchor and child scenarios. The parent problem is too big; the child scenario to small. The anchor problem , just right. For each anchor problem, consider alternatives --what is the persona doing now instead of what you want them to do; what other options currently exist that they\u2019re not using? Understanding the alternatives is necessary to understand the baseline and to specify conditions of satisfaction --in other words, how you\u2019ll know your solution is sufficiently better than the alternatives that the user will consider it. Craft problem hypotheses for the problems you most want to address or think are most important. These testable propositions will be evaluated through persona interviews or focus groups (you may want to combine this step with the persona interviews in step 3). Before moving on to the next step, where you will identify potential strategies, it is critical that you have a clear understanding of the problem space and have evidence supporting your hypotheses. By now you should have talked to experts and interviewed at least 5 relevant people. For more substantial endeavors, shoot for 30 people. There is no guarantee that this process will deliver a solution that will help you reach your vision for the world, but the chances of having an impact in a system you don\u2019t understand with people you can\u2019t relate to are slim.","title":"To a hammer, the whole world's a nail"},{"location":"metrics-design/step4-define-the-problem/#research-all-at-once","text":"To maximize the efficiency of your research process, and avoid having to interview people twice, you may want to hold off on interviews until you've developed both persona hypotheses and problem hypotheses.

Whether you've identified a new need within an existing project, are setting expectations with a client for a new tool, or simply replacing an old tool with a new one, we can help. Expect to meet at least three times as we work to understand the problem, define a solution, and develop a prototype. Our role can be minimal or more involved, from simply helping you think through the important details to building and supporting the product over the long term. Our process can be scaled to fit your needs large or small, supporting projects including: Building an internal tool Conducting a data analysis Creating a map, data visualization or dashboard Evaluating options for a technology solution Scoping a tool as a product/service for you practice area Developing a prototype prior to working with a technology partner Interfacing with technology partners Building a client-facing tool as a deliverable We'll work with you through the process of scoping , product definition , specification , implementation and adaptation . What's described below is optimized for developing a medium- to large-effort tool, but will be similar, though less involved, for lesser engagements. Scoping \u00b6 Scoping is all about understanding the situation and exploring the problem. We often start by asking you to describe your vision. If its our first time working on this program, we'd like to know your vision for the program, your conservation targets, etc. If we've already engaged, then we'll focus on your vision for the world in which this solution exists. Understanding your vision helps us know what a successful solution will look like. If that's too optimistic for you, we can instead focus on the problems you face, decisions you need to make, or jobs to be done. We'll have you list the problems and needs so we can zero in on the key problems, who is involved, and the overall situation. While you're describing the vision or problem, we'll be listening for three things. First, the people involved. Who are the users and what are their roles? Who are the stakeholders (those affected by the tool)? What are the users' capabilities? The list of people will be refined to a list of users and persona descriptions that describe their motivations and constraints. Second, their problems or needs. Which can be addressed? What are people doing instead? How will our solution improve upon the alternatives? Problems will be catalogued and we'll ultimately seek to identify the problem, or set of problems, that our solution will address first. Finally, context. How will this solution integrate with existing tools or processes? What are the requirements, constraints, and design considerations we must keep in mind? If we come up with questions you don't have an answer for, its helpful to have an expert (whether a true expert or just another member of the project team) available to get clarity before we move on. While we're not committing to a particular solution yet, we will want to work with you to identify priority problems to address by asking 'How Might We?'. This question allows us to transform problems into opportunities and get creative about potential solutions. After this meeting, we'll refine our understanding of what you told us, develop testable hypotheses for people and problems, and craft a research plan. We'll do background research to fill in gaps. We may even interview potential users to confirm our persona hypotheses and problem hypotheses. Product Definition \u00b6 Utilizing our research and what you've told us, we'll develop options for solutions and develop a recommendation. We'll return with a Product Definition and, potentially, a 'Minimum Viable Product' (MVP) - some tangible way for you to understand the recommended solution. The MVP is the minimum build sufficient to test key hypotheses we've developed. It may not even function at all (e.g., a 'wizard of oz' approach), but will simulate the experience of using the tool. It might be as simple as a drawing, a wireframe, or even a small version of what we'll eventually develop. We find it's better to have something tangible for you to react to so that you are fully aware of the look/feel and limitations of any solution. Otherwise you might be imaging a cure all that is impossible! Also, we may not be able to solve all of the problems (or meet all of the needs) all at once, if not, we'll pick an 'anchor problem' and start there. We'll keep track of other problems to be solved in future features. This is your chance to give us direction on the scope and solution. Did we overestimate the users capabilities? Forget a key requirement? It's our job to make sure you fully understand the implications of the proposed solution - who will manage it, what is its expected lifetime, what will it cost, etc. We'll also review roles, timeline, and necessary resources. Specification \u00b6 We'll document the specifications for the solution in our template Specifications Document , create our project plan and roadmap, and develop the solution or support you to get the product built with a technology provider. Before working with a technology provider, we may develop a simple prototype that will allow you to test and interact with the product so you can be very clear about what you want and how you want it to work. Implementation \u00b6 Implementation - the development and deployment of the solution- is simply iteration. We strongly recommend implementing the smallest workable subset of a solution possible. Don't wait for the perfect build out before putting it in the hands of your users. Also, don't overlook the importance of outreach to and education of both users and stakeholders. We can help you navigate the cycle of building and testing that is central to solution implementation. Adaptation \u00b6 Almost every tool requires some revision in the first year. We can provide support for the first year and recommend a structure process for adapting the product as needed after a full year of use. The adaptation process should, of course, be scaled to the size of the tool. Why have we developed this process? \u00b6 A common component of the delivery of metrics services is the design of tools. We have developed over the past few years a unique perspective and approach to developing tools to support metrics projects. Our tools can include a technology component (such as a scripting language like R or Python), but many do not. The design and development of tools, whether technological or not, is a unique skillset developed within the Metrics service line over the past few years. We have built out processes and products to facilitate the efficient development of tools that can be used both internally and externally to improve EI services and internal processes. In addition, some EI staff not explicitly included in the Metrics service line have also been developing skills and experience in overlapping areas (e.g., human-centered design). Our aim is to build EI's capacity for effective tool development by promoting the processes and products we have while incorporating the learning of other EI staff in those products and processes. We are not pretending to be a tech company when we are not, nor develop a competency in the development of software or hardware. EI will continue to work with technology providers to deliver robust technology solutions. Instead, this is an effort to describe and promote, internally and externally, a subset of the Metrics service line's skillset that is unique to Metrics service line experts. Tool design is central to this, but it can also include data analytics and visualization as stand-alone services. We also explore the opportunity and requirements to deliver Metrics services outside the typical program design and implementation package to new clients/markets, to existing clients, and to internal initiatives. The Metrics service line can support an effort as small as designing a new budget template to as large as developing an entire information management system for a large agency. We leverage our skills in consulting, design, development, and deployment created through past internal and external work. We work to improve EI's internal practices, expand our staff's understanding of what is possible, and deliver robust, user-friendly tools to clients. Additionally, we seek to increase the capacity of all EI staff to develop lasting solutions.","title":"How We Work"},{"location":"metrics-services/how-we-work/#scoping","text":"Scoping is all about understanding the situation and exploring the problem.

This is best done together in person, if possible, and typically requires at least an hour but can take half a day or more, depending on how invested you are in building out the Situation Model (feel free to sub in a systems map or journey map if preferred). If you've already developed some of these elements, great! Bring along a copy and start with a quick review. Find a large whiteboard and divide it up into sections as illustrated below (don't label each box as large as shown below, you'll need room to write). You can also find an editable version of this scoping canvas here . Instructions for filling in each section are provided below. Instructions \u00b6 Work through the sections in approximately this order, but don't hesitate to jump around if that's where the conversation flows. Scope \u00b6 A project\u2019s scope defines what the project intends to affect. \u201cPlace-based\u201d projects have a geographic scope and include efforts to conserve or effectively manage ecoregions, priority areas, or protected areas. \u201cThematic-based\u201d projects include efforts to address specific conservation targets, threats, opportunities, or enabling conditions and generally have a corresponding thematic scope. Thematic-based projects may also define a geographic scope that spatially describes a project area and might reference specific elements of biodiversity or a specific threat. (CMP 2013). I recommend erring on the inclusive side here. You will continue to get more specific throughout this process, for now try to represent the entire problem space. The scope should include the scope for the program, not just the specific tactic, tool, or feature you're considering. Vision \u00b6 In addition to defining the scope, it is also necessary to decide on a clear and common vision \u2013 a description of the desired state or ultimate condition that you are working to achieve. Your vision can be summarized in a vision statement, which meets the criteria of being relatively general, visionary, and brief. (CMP 2013) It's important to be agnostic about the solution within the vision statement. The vision is not for everyone to be using the tool your thinking about developing. Just describe the long-term outcomes that you're trying to achieve in sufficient detail that if you time-traveled to a time in which your strategy was successful, you'd know you were there. See Step 1: Start at the End of our metrics design philosophy for help if you get stuck. Situation Model & Interventions \u00b6 The Situation Model consists of one or more conservation targets, threats, and drivers. Interventions should be mapped where appropriate. See Step 2: Map It of our metrics design philosophy for inspiration. Conservation Targets \u00b6 Conservation targets are specific species or ecological systems/habitats that are chosen to represent and encompass the full suite of biodiversity in the project area for place-based conservation or the focus of a thematic program (CMP 2013). If you've already been through the process of developing a situation model, you should have a list of conservation targets to draw from. You may also already know which target is the focus of today's effort. For expediency, you can focus on the conservation target you are, well, targeting. If you're not sure, include them all. Place the conservation targets on the far right side of the Situation Model diagram. Threats \u00b6 Direct threats are primarily human activities that immediately degrade a conservation target (e.g., unsustainable fishing, unsustainable hunting, oil drilling, construction of roads, industrial wastewater, or introduction of exotic invasive species), but they can be natural phenomena altered by human activities (e.g., increase in extreme storm events or increased evaporation due to global climate change) or in rare cases, natural phenomena whose impact is increased by other human activities (e.g., a potential tsunami that threatens the last remaining population of an Asian rhino). (CMP 2013) Feel free to list all threats, but what we really need is the threat that is mapped to the key intervention point that strategy will attack. If you haven't chosen a key intervention point yet, go ahead and build out the entire thing. If you have, just build out the relevant parts. List threats vertically to the left of the conservation target . Drivers \u00b6 From the Conservation Measures Partnership, drivers are: key factors that drive the direct threats and ultimately influence your conservation targets. These include indirect threats (also known as root causes and drivers), opportunities, and enabling conditions (CMP 2013). If you already have a situation model, just copy over the relevant bits. Otherwise, list the key drivers and make connections where there are relationships. Place drivers in boxes, mapped to their relevant threats, and group like drivers. Draw lines to connect related drivers. Leave a bit of room for interventions. Interventions \u00b6 Finally, map the primary existing interventions (e.g., strategies or tactics employed by boundary partners or strategic partners in your problem space). These are typically captured in hexagonal polygons. Connect them to the relevant threats or drivers. Take a step back and determine which driver you would like to intervene on. This is your key intervention point. Circle the key intervention point(s) (or leverage point or pain point, etc.). This is where your group has chosen to focus, either with the entire program or with this specific tactic, tool, or feature. Stakeholders \u00b6 Stakeholders include everyone that is involved in the problem space or might be affected by your selected intervention. That may be a lot of people, which is why we'll focus in on Boundary Partners here. List stakeholders and underline boundary partners. Boundary partners are people or organizations you can directly influence. Stakeholders you can't directly influence, but can work with directly, are called Strategic Partners . You might put a star next to their name to distinguish them. Feel free to group stakeholders to maintain a manageable list, but at the same time identify an actual human being who would fit in that group. If a boundary partner is described as 'permitting staff at state agencies', find a real human being in a permitting department at a state in your geographic scope as an example. If you can't do that, your boundary partner probably doesn't actually exist. See Step 3: Develop Empathy of our metrics design philosophy for a lot more detail on this process. Problems \u00b6 If you're coming from the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation, everything so far has been very familiar. This is where we take a bit of a departure. Instead of jumping straight to listing strategies, we're going to think about how we can solve problems or create opportunities for the people whose behavior we need to change to achieve our conservation goal. Our strategy will be shaped by our understanding of these problems (but we actually won't define a specific strategy until the Product Definition step). Identify the most important boundary partner in your list. Ask yourself, what do we need them to do (or to stop doing) to achieve our conservation goal? In other words, what behaviors do we need them to exhibit in order that our vision is achieved? You might frame these as behaviors you'd 'expect to see', 'like to see', and 'love to see'. Now, write down the problems (or jobs to be done) that your boundary partners face in doing what you need them to do . Maybe they don't know where to get technical information, they don't have time to do it, they can't identify the priority areas to work, etc. If you - when you - talk to them about your proposed solution, they should relate to these problem statements - if not, these are not real problems (or jobs to be done) and solving them won't change their behavior. See Step 4: Define the Problem for helpful guidance on this prompt. Alternatives \u00b6 From the list of problems you've identified, have any of these problems been solved already? You may seek to solve them more expediently, which is great, but knowing what the alternatives are will allow you to evaluate your proposed solution against a real baseline. List the currently existing alternative solutions. How Might We? \u00b6 Now you can start to brainstorm solutions. \"How Might We?\" is a way of framing design questions that help you convert your problem statements into opportunities. If, for example, your boundary partners don't know where to find key information, how might we get that information to them? List the 'How Might We?' questions that address the problems you think will be most impactful for your boundary partners. Again, you'll take the time to craft your solutions during the Product Definition step. This will just give you a head start. Considerations/Constraints \u00b6 As your thinking about problems and potential solutions, you'll probably identify a few constraints on what you're able to do to solve the problem, or just some things to keep in mind going forward. Jot down any considerations and/or constraints so you don't forget. Research Questions \u00b6 This space is for recording questions that you don't have the answer to...yet. It might help to have an expert available during the scoping meeting so you don't get hung up on a question, but for those you can't address during the scoping meeting, write down the research questions and plan to get it answered before developing the Product Definition.

What technologies are required? What existing frameworks or packages are available? How will the project be deployed? Who are the users? Is the project worth the effort? How long will it take? How will the project be supported? These are the high-level questions that will shape the direction and scope of the project. Use the EI Data Driven Product - Product Definition to get started. Next, think about the general approach. What will the architecture of the project be? Which specific packages will be used? Should you set up a virtual environment? What will the user interface look like? How will the backend be managed? What testing approach will be used? What conventions will be used for file and folder naming, code style, etc.? Draft a Tool Specifications document if warranted (i.e., for large, billable projects). See the draft Tool Specifications outline in the EI Data Driven Product - Product Definition. You should have a clear plan in writing before starting with the first line of code. Example Project Plan \u00b6 Here's an example project plan for this project: Solution Description \u00b6 A web-based wiki for capturing and organizing information important to developing metrics products with a focus on performance-driven conservation programs. Goal & Objectives \u00b6 Goal \u00b6 Create a single source for documenting and sharing EI's approach to metrics product development and best practices for current and future staff. Objectives \u00b6 Compile all existing resources for data product development and create single platform for accumulating new resources. Present information in user-friendly format that balances instructional content with requirements for illustrating in-line code. Require staff focused on product development to work with technologies that will be used in deploying EI data products. Users \u00b6 Primary \u00b6 EI's metrics staff and other technical staff (e.g., Erik, Kristen, Maso) Problem Scenarios Alternatives Value Propositions \u200b Problem Scenarios: Metrics staff have developed standard processes and must learn new technologies frequently to deliver metrics products. Until now, this information has been scattered in multiple locations or lost entirely. New information that is learned or \u200b Value Propositions: This product will provide a common location for storing information and allow metrics staff to quickly access said information and re-familiarize themselves with important information quickly. Secondary \u00b6 Non-technical staff working with metrics staff to develop a data product (e.g., Kelsey) Problem Scenarios Alternatives Value Propositions \u200b Problem Scenarios: Non-technical staff are unaware of the capabilities available to them from metrics service line staff or are uncertain as to how to utilize those capabilities for their projects, both internal and external. \u200b Value Propositions: This product will include overviews of available services and technologies, as well as project examples, that non-technical staff can peruse at their leisure. Metrics staff can also use the wiki to introduce options and explain our engagement process. Use Cases \u00b6 User Stories \u00b6 As the metrics service line lead, I want to ______ so I can ______: Direct staff to a common resource so I can limit the time needed to train new staff on commonly used technologies and best practices. Encourage metrics staff to work with technologies like git and the command line so I can better integrate them into our workflows. As a metrics/technical staff, I want to ______ so I can ______: Quickly relearn previously used technologies so I can employ them in new projects with minimal spin up time. Communicate to non-metrics staff the options they have for a specific product, visualization or analysis so I can more quickly scope their projects. Capture and share new technologies, ideas, and other information as I discover it so I can reference it later and promote its use. As a non-metrics EI staff, I want to ______ so I can ______: Better understand the capabilities of EI staff to support on technology-based products so I can pitch them to clients or develop them for internal uses. Better understand the process for working with metrics service line staff so I can assess the feasibility of the product I'm considering. Product Sketch \u00b6 [Story Board, what did you learn from storyboarding?] Design Principles & Constraints \u00b6 (list 'em. Consider integration, hosting, support, adaptive management, deployment but don't get into details yet) Conditions of Satisfaction \u00b6 (How will we know this tool is successful?) Approach \u00b6 (Roles, Timeline, Resources required) As you can see, lots to be done! The folder order is roughly the prioritization for these pages. Thus, my approach will be to work through these pages in roughly this order. One objective for this project is to provide a place to store new information as it becomes available, so I'll create the above folders initially as markdown files of the same name within a 'tbd' folder where I can store links and other references as I come across them. I've also built some of the pages above in other formats (Evernote, Google Docs, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.) so I can now pull everything together into one place. Optional: Situation Model \u00b6 Optional: Results Chain \u00b6 \u00b6 (Move to Specs) \u00b6 Technologies: \u00b6 MkDocs - static site generator that requires Markdown Markdown - markup text language Typora - Markdown editor VS Code - IDE Git - version control Github - Repository Github Project Pages - Deployment (gh-pages branch); see MkDocs deployment documentation . Screen2Gif - a screen recording app that saves outputs as gifs (for video instruction) YouTube - custom videos for instruction, etc. Architecture \u00b6 The MkDocs package will create the basic architecture when creating the project . After creating the project, a mkdocs.yml file will be created. A docs folder will also be created with an index.md file within it. The index.md file manages the site outline; the mkdocs.yml file manages the settings. I'll add a README.md file in the root folder that will show up on the Github repo page.

How will this tech stack allow for illustrating using code? Can code be run within the deployment environment, or will static code blocks and outputs be needed? How often should links to a Jupyter Notebook, for example, be used as opposed to illustrating static code?

What technologies are required? What existing frameworks or packages are available? How will the project be deployed? Who are the users? Is the project worth the effort? How long will it take? How will the project be supported? These are the high-level questions that will shape the direction and scope of the project. Use the EI Data Driven Product - Product Definition to get started. Next, think about the general approach. What will the architecture of the project be? Which specific packages will be used? Should you set up a virtual environment? What will the user interface look like? How will the backend be managed? What testing approach will be used? What conventions will be used for file and folder naming, code style, etc.? Draft a Tool Specifications document if warranted (i.e., for large, billable projects). See the draft Tool Specifications outline in the EI Data Driven Product - Product Definition.
