Documentation for standard EI development practices

To push changes:
1. Open the local repository
2. Make sure you're working on the master branch (run `git status`)
3. Open the Anaconda Prompt* and run
```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```
Note that the Settings Tab, under project pages, should have the ghp-pages branch selected as the page

You can still run 'mkdocs build' to visualize the site while working on it

Add the `site/` folder to the gitignore file because it doesn't need to be served up to github

To add the Anaconda Prompt to your right-click context menu on windows, see this [gist](https://gist.github.com/jiewpeng/8ba446acf329b1801bf91db767d179ea).
